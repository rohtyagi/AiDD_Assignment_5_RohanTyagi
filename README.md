# AiDD_Assignment_5_RohanTyagi

Objective - 
This project involves creating a personal multi-page website that highlights your skills, interests, education, and accomplishments. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and basic web design principles, while also integrating AI-assisted development tools (like GitHub Copilot or Cursor) in a responsible and reflective manner.

Features - 
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
Semantic HTML Structure: Uses header, nav, main, and footer elements.
Consistent Styling: All pages share a unified color scheme, font, and layout.
Interactive Form: Includes validation for required fields and password checks.
Accessibility: Proper label and id linking, alt text for images, and error handling.
AI Documentation: Includes examples of AI prompts, responses, and reflection on AI assistance.

Step 1: Planning - 
Defined purpose, content, and design choices (color palette, layout, fonts).

Step 2: Implementation - 
Built pages using HTML and styled them with CSS for a cohesive layout and responsive experience.

Step 3: AI Integration - 
Used GitHub Copilot/Cursor to assist in writing repetitive code and generating form validation snippets.
All AI interactions are documented in .prompt/dev_notes.md.

Step 4: Testing - 
Validated HTML and CSS
Checked responsiveness
Ensured links and navigation worked
Tested in multiple browsers

AI Documentation - 
In .prompt/dev_notes.md, you’ll find:
Three or more AI prompts used during development
AI-generated responses
Reflections (≈150 words) on how AI impacted efficiency, where it made mistakes, and how human oversight balanced the process
